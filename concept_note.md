# Concept Note — Website Development Project

Title: Climate Action Hub for Goa — Connecting Communities to Local Climate Solutions

Objective
The website will inform, engage, and mobilize local communities in Goa around practical climate action (SDG 13). It will act as a hub for local projects, volunteer opportunities, events, educational resources, and reporting local observations (e.g., flooding, heatwaves, waste hotspots).

Chosen problem statement
Goa faces increasing climate-related stresses (coastal flooding, heat events, and changing rainfall patterns) that impact tourism, livelihoods, and heritage sites. Local communities often lack a centralized, accessible platform to learn about mitigation/adaptation options, find nearby initiatives, or coordinate volunteer efforts.

Why it is important
- Social impact: Timely local action reduces risks to lives, livelihoods, and cultural assets.
- Environmental impact: Community-driven projects (urban greening, distributed renewables, sustainable waste practices) reduce emissions and improve resilience.
- Educational impact: A focused website increases public awareness and helps build local capacity to implement practical solutions.

How the website addresses the problem
- Centralized Hub: Lists local projects, NGOs, and municipal programs with clear descriptions and contact actions (volunteer, donate, join events).
- Interactive Map & Reporting: Simple geolocated reporting for users to flag flooding, illegal dumping, or vulnerable heritage sites; entries can be routed to relevant local authorities or NGOs.
- Multimedia Resources: Articles, short videos, and audio interviews in English and Konkani to increase accessibility and engagement.
- Event & Volunteer Calendar: Filterable calendar for workshops, tree-planting drives, beach cleanups, and repair cafés.
- Project Cards & Stories: Card-based summaries (title, image, short description, CTA) for quick browsing — with deeper pages for impact data and how to help.
- Responsive & Accessible Design: Mobile-first layout with clear navigation and lightweight pages to work on low-bandwidth connections common in some field areas.

Planned technical approach
- Frontend: Semantic HTML, responsive CSS (Grid/Flexbox), and minimal JavaScript for interactivity. The design will include accessible components and media queries for tablet and mobile.
- Multimedia: Embed short videos (YouTube) and audio clips, with local fallbacks. Optimize images and provide alt-text and transcripts for audio/video.
- Data & Map: Use a simple GeoJSON-based map (Leaflet or embedded map iframe) for plotting reported locations. Reports will be captured via a simple form (no sensitive personal data).
- Deployment: Static hosting (GitHub Pages / Netlify) or a lightweight static server. Project files will be versioned on GitHub for evaluation and sharing.

Deliverables (WEEK 7)
- Concept note and one-page write-up (this document)
- A functional responsive website with:
  - Header/navigation, hero, content section with embedded multimedia
  - At least six multimedia/project cards and individual project pages
  - Event/volunteer calendar (can be a simple list or embedded calendar)
  - Interactive map or reporting form for local issues
- Project README with run/deploy instructions and screenshots

Evaluation mapping (per course rubric)
- Relevance & clarity of problem statement (40%): Focused on Goa's pressing climate impacts and a targeted local solution.
- Research & content quality (40%): The website will include curated resources, local contact info, and references — demonstrating content accuracy.
- Innovation & creativity (20%): Interactive map/reporting, multilingual multimedia, and community-focused workflows provide practical innovation at the local level.

Team & Roles (optional)
- 1–3 students: roles split across research/content, frontend development, and media/UX design.

Next steps
1. Confirm scope: would you like the project focused strictly on Goa (local map + partners) or broader regional examples?  
2. Approve this concept note so we can begin wireframes and content collection.
